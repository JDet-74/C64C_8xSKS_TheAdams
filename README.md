# C64C_8xSKS_TheAdams
<h3>8 times Switchless Kernal Switcher for the C64C based on the solution from TheAdams</h3>
<p>this is a modified version of the 8 times kernal switcher from TheAdams project published from Sven Arke.</p>
<p>I changed the layout of the PCB to a SMT version and a TQFP32 footprint for the ATMEGA8 MCU.</br>
Feel free to download the GERBER Files and DIY the project</p>
<p>I used a TC2030-MCP-NL connector to flash the ATMEGA8 MCU. You can flash it also with another Programmer and a TQFP32 to DIL adapter.</p>
<p>The pinout of the TC2030-MCP-NL connector is documented with the TC2030_ISP_footprint.png</p>
